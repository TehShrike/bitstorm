BitStorm was originally written by [Peter Caprioli](https://caprioli.se/) as a lightweight bittorrent tracker contained in a single PHP file.  As it used only a single flat file as a database, it had difficulty scaling past ~10 announces per second.

Peter created a fork of his project to add MySQL support, allowing it to scale.  In 2011, [Josh Duff](http://joshduff.com) made some changes to allow more efficient use of the database, and further scaling.

BitStorm: a very light bittorrent tracker that anyone can install!
